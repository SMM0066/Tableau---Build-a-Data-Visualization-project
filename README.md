# Tableau---Flight-Delays-and-Cancellations-Visualization-
Udacity Project 

In this project I used data comes from a Kaggle dataset it tracks the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015. Using Tableau, I created visualisations that answers multible questions and highlight patterns in the data set. Baised on my insights, I made a report includes the links to the Tableau sheets and dashboard with a summray of each visualisation.
